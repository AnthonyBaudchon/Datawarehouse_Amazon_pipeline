# Datawarehouse_Amazon_pipeline
Pipeline of data from an Amazon sales dataset to create a Datawarehouse with Visual Studio and SQL Server

On this project, there is a lot of work that have been done within the team.

I will upadte the github later when I get some time to do it.


What is planned to add here (for being able to replicate this project):
- add to the Github the SQL queries to build the databases on SSMS
- the pipelines built with SSIS to execute them on Visual Studio (and create the datawarehouse)
- the powerBI file to have the dashboard we made
- a file step-by-step on what to do for seeing the magic of this pipeline transforming raw data from a retail dataset to insightful dashboards



But here are some results from:
- ETL process with solid pipelines (STA -> ODS -> DWH)
- SQL Server Databases we used to maintain our DataWarehouse
- PowerBI dashboards to get insights from the SQL Server Datawarehouse

Let's enjoy some screenshots:
