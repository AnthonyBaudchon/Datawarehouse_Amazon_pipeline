# Amazon Retail Datawarehouse    
This [DSTI](https://dsti.school/) project aims to Extract, Transform and Load data into a DataWarehouse, as well as doing some analysis on it to answer potential business needs.     
<br>
Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratnesh10x10/amazon-sales     
<br>
Good exploration! And don't hesitate to connect with us :)      
       
## Overview     
About the output of this project, we got:    
- a complete ETL process with solid pipelines (STA -> ODS -> DWH) to build the DataWarehouse
- a Star Schema DataWarehouse for managing the transactional data
- SQL Server Databases we used to maintain the DataWarehouse    
- Interactive dashboards to get insights from the transformed data located in the DataWarehouse
     
         
## We worked as a team of 5 data engineers and data analysts, including:    
- Giti Shekari    
- Marie-Caroline Bertheau    
- Damien Rondet    
- Nans Long    
- Anthony Baudchon    
    
     
## On this repository, you can find:    
- the raw data --> folder Data
- the pipelines built with SSIS and executed on Visual Studio --> folder Pipelines       
- the SQL queries to build the databases on SSMS --> folder SQL_queries    
- the Power BI file with the dashboards we made --> fodler Dashboard
- the report of the project --> folder Report
      
    
## If you want to reproduce the project, you can:
- download the raw data from the link or from the data folder    
- pull the repository or download it as a zip file
- open Visual Studio and open the .sln file from the Pipelines folder
- create the databases with the SQL queries from the SQL_queries folder
- connect the raw data to each OLE_SRC bloc of each STA pipelines    
- run the Amazon_Exec file in Visual Studio (make sure to have the right connection manager set up)
- check the data in SSMS    
- analyse data on Power BI
